# Flanker-GPT

This repository contains code and analysis for the Flanker-GPT project, adapted from [nanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT).  
The repository provides all code, scripts, and notebooks required to reproduce the results reported in the thesis.

## Usage Notes

- All experiments were implemented in **Google Colab** with GPU acceleration.  
- The notebooks assume a Colab environment, including:
  - Google Drive mounting (`/content/drive/MyDrive/...`)
  - File paths that may need to be adjusted for your setup.

If you run locally, please modify the file paths in the notebooks accordingly.
